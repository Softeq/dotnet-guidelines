# Contributing to Softeq .NET Guidelines
The repository is maintained using [Scaled Trunk-Based Development practices](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

## Pull request guidelines
- Create a **separate feature branch** for your changes.
- If there is a related issue, mention it in your commit message (see [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) for more details).
- Create changes as small as possible: the less changes you want to merge, the easier it will be to review them.

## Adding a new rule
- Use the [proper name format](https://github.com/Softeq/dotnet-guidelines#guidelines-rules-naming-convention)
- Keep rule description consistent and simple
- Check R# schema can be extended to support the rule
